# Typed TodoMVC Hyperapp

Experiment in typings for Hyperapp, with a TodoMVC implementation as demo/sandbox.

Try it out by:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zaceno/zx-typed-todomvc-hyperapp.git
cd zx-typed-todomvc-hyperapp
npm i
npm start
# then open your browser at https://localhost:8080/ for a live 
# preview. Then start hacking away
```

The implementation is the same as the one described in my [tutorial video series][https://zaceno.github.io/codealong-hyperapp], except everything is strictly typed using typescript (or should be).

It's not perfect yet by any means. Please help me improve them! Install and experiment as above.

My overall goal is developer experience (not 100% perfect academic type safety), so prioritizing safety from the sort of mistakes that are easy to make over obscure errors. Also users should not have to annotate too much – that is also a priority.
